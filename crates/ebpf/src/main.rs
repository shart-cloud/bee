#![no_std]
#![no_main]

//! bee eBPF LSM programs.
//!
//! Programs are attached globally (`BPF_LSM_MAC`) and scope enforcement per cgroup by filtering on
//! `bpf_get_current_cgroup_id()`. Return `0` to allow, a negative errno to deny.
//!
//! Two hooks:
//! * `socket_connect` — deny outbound connections for a bee-managed cgroup (no struct reads).
//! * `file_open` — resolve the path with `bpf_d_path` and apply the per-scope rule list: deny
//!   subtrees/patterns, and enforce read-only (`read`-marked paths block write-opens) plus
//!   deny-by-default writes for scopes that declare a writable surface. The requested access is the
//!   `FMODE_WRITE` bit of `file->f_mode`, read by a direct load at a constant offset.
//!
//! **A hook that cannot evaluate an operation refuses it** ([`deny_unevaluated`]). Null arguments,
//! an unavailable scratch buffer, a `bpf_d_path` failure, and an address family the hook does not
//! decode all return the denial errno rather than `0`, and all emit an audit record. The trigger is
//! reachable by an attacker — a directory chain longer than the 4KB path buffer, a pathless memfd
//! image, an AF_UNIX destination the `host:port` policy language cannot describe — so allowing on
//! failure handed out exactly the operation the scope exists to mediate. This only applies once the
//! scope has been shown to enforce that dimension; an unenforced scope still returns `0` early.
//!
//! `bpf_d_path` needs a `*mut path`; we get it as `&file->f_path`. The `file`/`path`/`linux_binprm`
//! structs in `aya-ebpf-bindings` are opaque, so we read fields at compile-time-constant offsets (the
//! BPF verifier requires *constant* offsets into a BTF pointer, so these cannot be made
//! runtime-configurable — full kernel portability requires CO-RE relocation of these offsets).
//!
//! The offsets live in [`bee_common::offsets`] (shared source of truth) and target kernel 6.8 x86_64.
//! Because a wrong offset reads the wrong field and fails **open**, user space validates them against
//! the running kernel's BTF at startup and refuses to enforce on a mismatch (`bee-userspace::kbtf`).
//! To retarget another kernel, update `bee_common::offsets` from its BTF: `pahole -C file | grep -E
//! 'f_mode|f_path'` and `pahole -C linux_binprm | grep file`.
//!
//! NOTE on CO-RE: true auto-relocating CO-RE is not currently achievable here. `aya-tool`/bindgen
//! generate plain `#[repr(C)]` bindings with **no `preserve_access_index`**, so aya-ebpf field access
//! compiles to fixed offsets and emits no BPF_CORE_FIELD relocations — functionally identical to
//! these constants. (aya's *loader* can apply CO-RE relocations, but the probe side doesn't emit
//! them.) Porting across kernels therefore means updating these two constants until the Rust eBPF
//! toolchain gains `preserve_access_index` field-relocation support.
