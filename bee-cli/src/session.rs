//! Session construction, shared by `bee run` and `bee repl` (consolidation issue 03).
//!
//! `bee-episode` and `bee-repl` each built a session from scratch: set the process non-dumpable,
//! resolve and install the theme, load the provider, read the key from its named variable, build
//! the model. Two copies, in two orders, with two sets of error strings — and when they drifted,
//! the enforcement behaviour of a headless run and an interactive run drifted with them.
//!
//! This is that sequence, once. It takes an [`EffectiveConfig`] and returns the pieces a session
//! runs on. What it deliberately does *not* do is decide anything: the presentation choices, the
//! consent prompting, and the sandbox lifetime belong to the command, because those are the parts
//! that genuinely differ between headless and interactive.
