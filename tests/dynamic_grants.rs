//! Mid-session capability grants through the REPL exchange loop (007-dynamic-grants).
//!
//! These are the tests that only became writable once `run_exchange` dispatched `StepEvent`s (T009).
//! Before that, escalation ran in `run_loop` only — where 006-skills' startup pass has already
//! resolved every discovered skill's `requires` against the same ceiling with the same sink, so the
//! proactive hook could not grant anything the preload had not. An episode is pre-authorized by its
//! ceiling *file*; an interactive session has an operator in front of it, which is the whole reason
//! a capability asked for mid-session is a question rather than a formality.
//!
//! What is covered here is therefore the **proactive** cycle (US2) end to end: a grant that widens,
//! a grant that is refused unpromptably, a grant that is already held and must not nag, and a sink
//! that never answers.
//!
//! **Not covered here:** the reactive cycle (US1). It triggers on a kernel denial, and
//! `Sandbox::Host` has no kernel — `drain_audit` returns an empty vec unconditionally
//! (`src/sandbox.rs`), so no host test can produce the `KernelDenial` event that starts it. Its
//! coverage is the VM matrix (`reload-widen-allow`, `reload-beyond-ceiling`; tasks T018), plus the
//! unit tests on `escalate()` itself. Giving the host sandbox a way to replay scripted audit events
//! would close the gap and was deliberately not done: it would put a test seam in the type that
//! mediates enforcement.
