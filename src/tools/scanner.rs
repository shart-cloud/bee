//! The `scan` tool (016-native-tools US3): run a granted external scanner, in scope, fail-closed.

//! ```
//!
//! Every one of those is a child. The harness never runs a scanner, never reads a report, and never
//! asks a binary what version it is — all three would be the harness reaching around the sandbox it
//! is meant to be imposing (Constitution III).
//!
//! Forced by measurement (research R4): an Opengrep SARIF over one file is 1,912,546 bytes against a
//! 102,400-byte `DEFAULT_OUTPUT_CAP`. Capturing it on stdout truncates it into unparseable JSON,
//! which surfaces as "the scanner found nothing" — the failure FR-012 exists to prevent. Writing a
//! file solves that; normalising it in a *second child* rather than in the harness is what keeps the
//! promise that the harness never opens a file inside the sandbox (Constitution III).
//!
//! ## Success is decided by the report, never the exit status
//!
//! Measured: `opengrep scan --sarif --quiet` exits **0 with a finding present** — it only returns
//! non-zero on findings when `--error` is passed (research R6). An exit status conflates "findings
//! exist" with "run failed" and is wrong in both directions, so the ladder is: finished within
//! budget → report parses → `executionSuccessful` → only then a result.
