//! Where a tool child runs: hardened + credential-stripped, optionally confined to a bee scope.
//!
//! This is the seam that lets one loop serve both builds (research H6):
//! * [`Sandbox::Host`] — a hardened, credential-stripped host process with **no** kernel scope.
//!   Default build; used by offline (`MockModel`) tests and the live-provider smoke.
//! * `Sandbox::Enforced` — the tool child joins a real bee scope cgroup and kernel denials are
//!   drained from the audit ring (`--features enforce`; the VM enforcement case).
//!
//! A tool never pre-checks paths against policy (contracts/tool-contracts.md): it attempts the
//! operation in the sandbox and reports whatever the kernel decided (Constitution III).
