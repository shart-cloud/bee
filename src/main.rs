//! `bee` — the bee application and its sole host executable (ADR-0002). It adds no enforcement
//! logic of its own: every command here assembles `bee-core` + `bee-userspace` and gets out of the
//! way (constitution Principle V). See `contracts/cli.md` for the command surface + exit codes.
//!
//! The command tree grows over the consolidation (`.scratch/application-consolidation/`): `check`,
//! `validate`, and `exec` live here today; `run`, `repl`, and `metrics` arrive with the later
