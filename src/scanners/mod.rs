//! The external scanner tier (016-native-tools US3).
//!
//! An adapter wraps a third-party scanner whose value is its **rule corpus**, not its engine
//! (research R2). bee does not reimplement corpora, and — the load-bearing half — it does not hand
//! the model a command line either.
//!
//! ## Two authorities, deliberately separated
//!
//! | Question | Answered by | Why there |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | May this episode execute this binary? | the policy's `ExecPolicy.allow` | it is a capability, so it goes through the ordinary derive/ceiling attenuation path (FR-008) |
//! | How is the binary configured? | `[security.scanners.<name>]` | it confers no authority on its own; putting it in policy would widen the policy surface for nothing (Constitution IV) |
//! | What gets scanned? | the model, via [`ScanRequest`] | the one decision the model is well placed to make |
//!
//! [`ScanRequest`] has three fields and none of them is free-form: no `extra_args`, no
//! `config_inline`, no passthrough of any kind. This is the discipline [`crate::search`] already
//! states for ripgrep, generalised — *there is nothing here that runs another program* except the
//! one the operator pinned.
//!
//! ## The pin is checked twice, and the second time is the one that counts
//!
//! A grant records the binary's identity when it is resolved. [`ScannerAdapter::probe`] re-reads it
//! **immediately before spawning**, so a binary swapped between grant issuance and run yields
//! [`UnavailableReason::PinMismatch`] and is never executed (FR-009, SC-010). In an `enforce` build
//! the kernel holds the same pin; in a host build this check is the only one, which is exactly why
//! it lives at the tool layer rather than being left to the LSM.
