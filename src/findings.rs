//! The finding ledger (016-native-tools US2): an append-only event log, folded into a view.
//!
//! A security finding that lives only in an episode's transcript dies with the episode. The next run
//! rediscovers it, the operator re-reads it, and any judgement they formed about it — *this one is a
//! false positive, we sanitise upstream* — has to be formed again. That is the failure this module
//! exists to prevent, and its whole shape follows from two requirements that pull against each other:
//!
//! * **Re-runs must merge** (FR-018/019). Finding the same defect twice is one entry with two
//!   sightings, never two entries.
//! * **A human's verdict outranks a machine's rediscovery** (FR-020). An automated sighting can
//!   never clear an adjudication, no matter how many times it fires.
//!
//! A mutable `findings.json` satisfies neither safely: merging becomes read-modify-write, which
//! races, and a rediscovery that rewrites an entry can silently drop the verdict attached to it. So
//! the log is the source of truth and is only ever **appended** to; [`fold`] derives the current
//! state. Merging is then a property of the fold rather than of a write, and a verdict cannot be
//! overwritten because nothing is ever overwritten (contract `finding-ledger.md`).
//!
//! ## What is trusted here, and what is not
//!
//! `title` and `evidence` are attacker-reachable: they come from a model reading target source, or
//! verbatim out of a third-party scanner's report. They enter the ledger as **data**. Every front-end
//! runs them through [`crate::safe_text`] before display (FR-015), and nothing in this module
//! interprets them.
//!
//! ## Where this runs
//!
//! In the harness, not in a sandboxed child. That is deliberate and is not the seam
//! [`crate::search`]/[`crate::astgrep`] protect: those read *target* files, which must be mediated by
//! the LSM, whereas `.bee/findings/` is bee's own state — the same category as the episode
//! transcript, which the harness has always written directly.
