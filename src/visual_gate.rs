//! The visual permission gate (009-tachyonfx-effects, US2): how much screen the agent may claim.
//!
//! [`VisualLevel`] is a **ceiling**, not a mode — level `takeover` permits everything the lower
//! levels permit. A request above the ceiling is **downgraded, never refused** (FR-009): the model
//! gets a working visual plus a note saying what happened, so it can adapt on the next turn. Failing
//! the tool call instead would make a level-`panels` session error every time the model reached for
//! a takeover, which teaches the model to stop rendering at all.
//!
//! The gate runs **before any panel or overlay state mutates** — in the render tool, on the way out
//! of the script evaluation — so the downgraded target is the only one anything downstream ever
//! sees. It lives at the crate root rather than under `tui` (where tasks.md placed it) because the
//! render tool is not feature-gated: an inline-REPL or headless session resolves a level too, and a
//! gate the render tool cannot call in a headless build would be no gate at all.
