//! [`SessionEvent`] (008-grid-tui, T004 / data-model.md): what the shared session core says as a turn
//! progresses.
//!
//! The turn loop ([`crate::repl::run_exchange`]) already writes everything through the
//! [`crate::repl::ReplOutput`] trait — that trait *is* the engine's output seam. `SessionEvent` is a
//! faithful 1:1 mirror of those callbacks, so a front-end (the TUI) can reconstruct exactly what the
//! inline REPL renders. Renderer-agnostic — no ratatui/rustyline types leak in.
