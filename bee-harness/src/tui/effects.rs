//! The effects pipeline (009-tachyonfx-effects): resolve [`EffectSpec`] data into live tachyonfx
//! effects, own them, and advance them each frame.
//!
//! **This module is the single chokepoint** every effect passes through (research R5). That matters
//! for FR-006c: when animations are disabled, [`resolve`] returns `None` for everything, nothing is
//! ever registered, [`Effects::is_running`] is permanently false, and the render loop therefore
//! *cannot* enter its 60fps state. Suppression is structural rather than a rule each of a dozen call
//! sites has to remember.
//!
//! Effects are applied to the ratatui [`Buffer`] **after** widgets render and **before** the buffer
//! is flushed (FR-001) — they transform already-drawn cells, they do not draw.
//!
//! Determinism: tachyonfx carries its own seeded `SimpleRng` and has no `rand` dependency, so the
//! character-scatter effects reproduce for a given area and timeline. That is what makes the
//! snapshot assertions below meaningful rather than flaky.
