//! Interactive REPL (US5): a human chats with a sandboxed coding agent in real time.
//!
//! Where [`crate::episode`] drives a *scripted* task to completion and stops, the REPL replaces that
//! outer driver with an interactive loop — the user types a message, the agent responds (making any
//! number of tool calls along the way), everything is shown, and control returns to the user for the
//! next message. The conversation persists for the whole session.
//!
//! The *inner* agent-turn loop is structurally similar to the episode loop but has different
//! semantics — text-only means "back to the user", not "episode ends"; there is no wall-clock
//! deadline; the conversation outlives a single exchange — so it is its own code here. It reuses the
//! same low-level building blocks: [`Model::stream`], [`ToolRegistry::execute`],
//! [`Sandbox::drain_audit`]. `episode.rs` is deliberately left untouched.
//!
//! ## Live IO model
//!
//! The session keeps exactly one `readline` outstanding at all times, on a blocking thread. When the
//! user is idle its result is the next message/command; while an exchange is running the same
//! outstanding line becomes a *steering* message — queued and injected before the agent's next model
//! call, so the user can redirect the agent mid-task without interrupting and cold-starting. All
//! agent output flows through a rustyline [`ExternalPrinter`](rustyline::ExternalPrinter) so it
//! scrolls above the live input line rather than corrupting it, and assistant prose streams in a
//! line at a time as the model generates it.
